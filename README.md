# Prescription Recognition and Chatbot Streamlit App

This Streamlit application allows users to upload medical prescriptions for text extraction and interact with a chatbot to get information about medicines. The app combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction with a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) and a medicine database.

## Architecture

The application consists of the following modules:

- **Streamlit Frontend**: The user interface where users interact with the app.
- **OCR Module**: Extracts text from uploaded prescription images.
- **Chatbot Module**: Handles user queries related to medicines using a LLM.
- **Medicine Database Module**: Provides information about medicines.
